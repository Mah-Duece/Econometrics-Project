This analysis aims at finding a relationship that links personal metrics (i.e. Race, Sex, Region) with health disparities across the United States. The use of multilinear regression is used to find a linear relationship between the predictors and targets (Chronic Disease, Smoking Habits, Drinking Habits, BMI levels).

The data is extracted from IPUMS/NHIS database. Courtsy of Lynn A. Blewett, Julia A. Rivera Drew, Miriam L. King and Kari C.W. Williams.
